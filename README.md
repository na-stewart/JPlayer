# JPlayer
An all-in-one Java media player, inspired by my [first ever project](https://github.com/na-stewart/Media-Player) for the COMP-1100 final.

##  How to use
1. Make sure to download java 8 at oracle.com which works for any operating system.
2. Download the .jar file from the releases tab and you should be able to run it!
